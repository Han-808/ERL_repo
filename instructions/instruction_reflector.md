USER:
You are an expert analyst and educator. Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong when coming up the predicted answer.

**Instructions:**
- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong
- Take the environment feedback into account
- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies
- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future
- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors
- Be specific about what the model should have done differently
- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.
- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)
- For this grid-navigation game, the predicted answer is the action sequence selected by the Generator, and the environment feedback plus reward is the observed outcome.
- Ground every claim in the observation, reasoning trace, feedback, reward, and playbook. Do not invent unobserved grid-symbol meanings.

Your output should be a json object, which contains the following fields
  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations
  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?
  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?
  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?
  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?
  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator
